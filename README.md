Exercise name: Weather Sprint
Description: Tried to created a fully functioning weather application (Current Weather and 5 day forecast). Tried to create a favorite list function. All while trying to replicate one on one Elizabeth's Figma

Peer Reviewed by: Jerrod Packard

Peer Review comment: The design looks nice, but the functionality isn't quite there yet. The current weather doesn't update on search and the favorites functionality isn't working yet. It would be really nice if the geolocation function updated everything and if the current time and date would update. Your design is nice though and it looks pretty close to the Figma, nice work there! This has potential to be a good looking weather app. Keep working on it and you'll have a nice piece to show off.
